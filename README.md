## Description

This project was coded by Nicolas Towery as part of [Jonas Schmedtmann's React Course.](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/) The project utilizes React Router, React Query, and React Hook Forms for complex UI and remote state management.

The Wild Oasis is a faux-business backend Create Read Update Delete (CRUD) application for cabin bookings. The application is complete with user authentication. Users have the ability to perform CRUD operations on cabins, users, business settings, as well as read, update, and delete bookings that customers ficticiously place.

It leverages React Query to manage and provide remote data in a snappy, user-friendly manner.

There are multiple custom built components for this project, such as the Modal component, that are built with reusability in mind.
